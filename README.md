# AmortizationCalculator
This amortization (am-er-tuh-zey-shuhn) calculator is designed to build on the features you find with most
online amotization schedule calculators. When playing with my mortgage and calculating early payments, I 
often found them lacking. 
<br><br>
What does this calculator offer that others don't?
  1. variable additional monthly payments (allowing you to plan for increases or decreases over time)
  2. variable additional yearly payments (think tax refund and months with three paychecks)
  3. multiple one-time payments
  4. table that shows you what additional monthly payments would do to your interest paid and life of your loan
<br><br>

Future plans:
  - calculate optimized additional payment amount
  - compare additional payments on current loan with refi to determine which is the better option
