Amortization calculations
M = monthly mortgage payment
P = principal loan amount
r = monthly interest rate (annual interest rate / 12)
n = number payments over lifetime of loan

M = P ((r(1+r)^n) / (((1+r)^n)-1))
P = (M(((1+r)^n)-1)) / (r(1+r)^n)

Interest calculations
interest vs APR - https://www.investopedia.com/calculate-principal-and-interest-5211981
P = principal balance
i = interest rate
I = amt paid toward interest each payment

P * (i/12) = I

------------------------
New balance calculations
B = new balance
I = amt paid toward interest each payment
P = principal balance

B = P - I
